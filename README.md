### Rotating Gears Problem with Solution
**Problem Statement:**
A clock smith must convert power between two gears on a giant clock.
Admittedly, the engineer isn't concerned with efficiency and insists on using other gears to
fill the space without using any type of belt or chain. In his supply, he has an unlimited number
of gears that measure: 1cm, 2cm, 3cm, 5cm, 7cm, and 8cm in diameter.
Any two gears fit perfectly together, for example: a 3cm gear right next to a 7cm gears will measure
10 cm all together.
The distance between the two ends is exactly 1 meter across. The centers of the gears must be 
attached along a line between the Blue and Red gears.

How many combinations of gears can the clock smith connect so that the Blue Gear will rotate in the
same direction as the Red Gear?
For instance, he could use twelve 8cm gears, with one 2cm gears and two 1 cm gears for a total of 15.
(This specific set only counts as 1 solution. Ignore the different arrangements these gears could be in.)

**Bonus Question:**
Suppose we do care about the number of arrangements of each set. How many ways can the clock smith arrange
gears so that the Blue and Read gear will rotate in the same direction?

**Final Answer:**
Order does not matter: 44,958
